# Strengths

1. Git provides the best performance when it comes to version control systems. Committing, branching, merging all are optimized for a better performance than other systems.
2. Git is an Open Source. Being open source invites the developers from all over the world to contribute to the software and make it more and more powerful through features and additional plugins.
